INTRODUCTION
------------

When CDDB was first developed, users which wanted to contribute to the CDDB 
had to send their xmcd-format database entries to the CDDB, where they were
manually included in the database. Later the CDDB server software was able to
handle submissions automatically, which had to be sent to a specific 
e-mail-address.
Many CDDB-aware programs implemented support for submission to the CDDB. As the
e-mail submit method was a bit complicated (users having to specify an 
smtp-server etc.), a method was developed to submit entries via http via a 
submit.cgi. The submit.cgi accepts the data via http POST and creates a 
submission-e-mail to the normal submit-address.
As the submit.cgi was introduced after the CDDB server software used by 
CDDB.com became closed source in late 1997, the freedb submit.cgi was 
written using the specifications, which were available in the cddb.howto 1.27.
People involved in the development of the freedb submit.cgi were 
Michael Kaiser, Andy Key and Jörg Hevers.
The specifications for submission via the submit.cgi can be found in the 
freedb.howto, which is available from the freedb website at 
http://www.freedb.org.

Please see the file CHANGELOG for a list of changes in this and earlier 
versions.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

In order to use the submit.cgi you need to have this installed:

- perl
- the perl MIME::QuotedPrint module. If you do not have this module installed,	 	
  you can get it (included in the MIME::Base64 package) from CPAN at	 	
  http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=MIME-Base64
- the perl CGI.pm module, which should already be included in the perl 
  distribution. If it is missing on your system, you can get it from CPAN at
  http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=CGI.pm
- and of course you need a webserver ;-)
- a mailserver like sendmail
 
INSTALLATION
------------

Put the submit.cgi in the same directory where your cddb.cgi is located 
(usually the public_html directory of the user cddb and/or the cgi-bin 
directory).
If your sendmail program is not located at /usr/sbin/sendmail
you must open the submit.cgi in an editor and adjust the string assigned to 
$sendmailcmd.
If you intend to run an official freedb mirror or if you intend to forward
the submissions accepted by the submit.cgi to freedb.org, you're now done.
Otherwise you will have to adjust the strings assigned to $submit and 
$testsubmit in the submit.cgi to the appropriate e-mail addresses. The values 
of these two variables can also be a comma-separated list of several 
e-mail-addresses, to which the submissions shall be forwarded.
