These programs here are used for freedb's search engine.  It uses
a few components from the SF hyx-tools repository.  I think, all
components are now publically available, however, some of them are
in a raw form which.  They will be packaged for easier consumption.
With other words, they will be packaged into tar.gz files.  Nobody
will be forced to wade through the original repository.
