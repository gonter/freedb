<h1>LMD as a freedb search tool</h1>

<p>Quick notes about the LMD indexer for the freedb database.</p>

<p>The LMD indexer works in several phases:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#phase1">search term extraction</a>
<li><a href="#phase2">index generation</a>
<li><a href="#phase3">search</a> (this is done by the users using
    WWW forms and CGI scripts)
<li><a href="#phase4">display</a>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2><a name="phase1">Search Term extraction</h2>

In this phase, each freedb file is examined and two files
for are created for each category:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>&lt;category&gt;.catalog<td>document catalog (list db files)
<tr><td>&lt;category&gt;.stream<td>list of search terms
</table>
</p>

This phase is invoked by a command line like this:
<pre>
  ./cddb-t1.pl -dir cddb-main
</pre>

cddb-t1.pl does not need to be modified but expects two symlinks:
<ul>
<li>a directory name like the symlink cddb-main above that
    points to the directory where the freedb database files
    are stored.
<li>a symlink named "db" which points to a directory where
    it can store the catalog and stream files.  These files
    need to be readable for the CGI scripts!
</ul>

<h2><a name="phase2">Index generation</h2>
The stream files written by cddb-t1.pl are read by lutmake
which will produce three additional files:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>&lt;category&gt;.lt<td>word lookup table
<tr><td>&lt;category&gt;.wr<td>word reference table
<tr><td>&lt;category&gt;.di<td>document index table
</table>
</p>

lutmake is not called directly, instead, another Perl script
called "indexer.pl" does that.  Besides that it uses "tfblut"
to write another index file:
<table border=1>
<tr><td>&lt;category&gt;.lut<td>index for the document catalog
</table>
</p>

indexer.pl is invoked in the directory where the stream and
catalog files are located.

</dl>

<h2><a name="phase3">Search</h2>

The search is performed by a CGI script called "cddb-locate.pl",
it needs to be configured:

<pre>
# configure this
my $db=     '/www/CD/db';
my $FMT=    'http://whisky.wu-wien.ac.at/cgi-bin/cdfmt';
my $deref=  '/usr/local/bin/deref';
my $tfbget= '/usr/local/bin/tfbget';
</pre>

<p>$db points to the directory where the stream, catalog, etc. files
are located.</p>

<p>$FMT is the URL for the CGI script that is used to display freedb
database files.</p>

<h2><a name="phase4">Retrieval</h2>

This script is used to display freedb database files, it also
needs to be configured:

<pre>
# configure this
my $db_base= 'http://whisky.wu-wien.ac.at/freedb/db';
my $my_url=  'http://whisky.wu-wien.ac.at/cgi-bin/cdfmt';
my $base=    '/archive/cddb/db';
</pre>

<h2>Tools Summary</h2>

These scripts are built upon several other tools:
<ul>
<li>Binary files<br>
    <table border=1>
    <tr><td>lutmake<td>
    <tr><td>deref<td>
    <tr><td>tfblut<td>
    <tr><td>tfbget<td>
    </table>
    These tools are distributed in a package called "lmd-&lt;date&gt;.tar.gz"
    and need to be compiled using a C compiler.
<li>A group of Perl modules using the package prefix "Net::freedb::".
    The files are<br>
    <table border=1>
    <tr><td>Net/freedb/file.pm<td>handles freedb/cddb database files
    <tr><td>Net/freedb/track.pm<td>module use to handle track
                                   information from freedb files
    <tr><td>Net/freedb/tools.pm<td>various utility functions
    <tr><td>Net/freedb/cluster.pm<td>(not used here)
    </table>
    These Perl modules need to be installed where the other Perl scripts
    can find them, either under "site_perl" or somewhere else.
<li>The Perl scripts themselves:
    <table border=1>
    <tr><td>cddb-t1.pl<td>search term extraction <a href="#phase1">(phase 1)</a>
    <tr><td>indexer.pl<td>index generation <a href="#phase2">(phase 2)</a>
    <tr><td>cddb-locate.pl<td>CGI: search <a href="#phase3">(phase 3)</a>
    <tr><td>cdfm.pl<td>CGI: display <a href="#phase4">(phase 4)</a>
    </table>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compile the C programs from lmd-&lt;date&gt;.tar.gz and place them
    in a directory where they can be found by the CGI scripts,
     e.g. /usr/local/bin.
<li>Install the Net::freedb Perl modules
<li>Install the CGI scripts into your CGI direcory.  Be sure
    that the scripts can find the binary modules, the raw cddb
    files as well as the index files
<li>Install the indexer generation files
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>T2D/Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stop words are not handled properly.  Using a stop word in
    the search term will result in an empty list.  A stop word
    is usually marked in the LMD index and should be ignored
    during lookup.  There is code that does exactly this but
    somehow this doesn't work.<br>
    <b>2001-08-26</b>: fixed, needs testing.
<li>the predefined stopword list in the file top200.lst is not
    properly handled, but this doesn't seem to cause problems.
<li>Incremental index update should be added.  It is not necessary
    to process freedb items that were already processed in an
    earlier index run.  LMD has code for this but the search
    term extracter does not use it yet.
<li>References to the name "cddb" should be replaced by "freedb",
    especially the Perl modules should be renamed.
</ul>

<h2>License</h2>

This application is structured in three parts.  Since they are
developed and used in different contexts, this means that these
parts have different licenses.

<ul>
<li>the binary LMD tools: BSD-style
<li>the Net::freedb Perl modules: Perl-style
<li>the freedb search scripts: GNU Public license
</ul>
